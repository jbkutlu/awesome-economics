1.  **Alphabetical Order:** All lists and tables must be sorted alphabetically by the resource name.
2.  **Flags & Icons:** When adding institutions or people, use the appropriate country flag (e.g., 🇺🇸, 🇩🇪).
3.  **Concise Descriptions:** Keep descriptions to one or two clear sentences.
4.  **Markdown Tables:** If adding to a section that uses tables (like *Influential Figures* or *Software*), match the existing structure exactly.
